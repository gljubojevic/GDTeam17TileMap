Bit\byte swapping
==================
The Amiga computer uses a Motorola 680x0 CPU, which stores it's values in big endian format. Intel x86 CPUs store
data in little endian format. So when dealing with data bigger than 1 byte, the bytes need to be swapped. For example
a pair of bytes describing which tile and what special it has is stored in a 2 byte integer value. Keep this in mind
when dealing with Superfrog's data files. The descriptions here assume all bytes have been swapped already.

Froggy uses a bitstream reader which swaps the bits around. If you request 4 bits, it will return the *last* 4 bits of the
current byte, in reverse order.


Graphics
=========
Graphics can be full-screen bitmaps, used for the world ending pictures (The Golden Key, Colin the Troll, etc.),
but can also store sprites and for example the slotmachine graphics.

They are arranged as bitplanes (as is often the case in Amiga graphics):

Bitplane 0
    Row 0 of [width] bits
    Row 1
    Row 2
    ...
    Row [height]
Bitplane 1
    ...
Bitplane [bitplanes]

Xor'ing the bits of each bitplane into a single value results in a color index into a palette. After the
bitplane data are 64 bytes that define the palette for the image, if the image has a palette at all (see
"Graphics information"). Each color takes 2 bytes:

Bit 0-3     Always zero
Bit 4-7     Red value
Bit 8-11    Green value
Bit 12-15   Blue value

Multiplying the red, green or blue values by 17 will give a color in the 0 to 255 range.

                                                            seems to be designed for a 20-tile width display in
                                                            an editor.

                                                            detection purposes.


Level data
===========
The layout of a level file is very similar to a (R)IFF file, with chunks, chunk lengths and chunk contents.
First is always a 4-byte string indicating the name of the chunk, then a long integer indicating the length
of the chunk, then the chunk's data.

The following chunks are present in all of Superfrog's level files:

Id      Guessed name    Description
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
T7MP    Team 17 Map     Contains the length of the entire file, including this chunk.
XBLK    X Block         Number of tiles on the map horizontally (always 300)
YBLK    Y Block         Number of tiles on the map vertically (always 85)
VERS    Version         Always zeroes.
COM1    Player 1        Always zeroes.
COM2    Player 2        Always zeroes.
REMX    ?               Unknown, varies per level.
REMY    ?               Unknown, varies per level.
IFFP    IFF Palette     Starts with the string SDIFF:L1BM-IFF, after which there are 50 bytes of zeroes.
PALA    Palette A       Starts with the string SDIFF:L1BM-IFF, after which there are 50 bytes of zeroes, after
                        which the level's palette data follows. The palette is arranged the same way as it is
                        appended to bitplane images. After this data, another 64 zero bytes follow.
PALB    Palette B       Like palette A, but all zeroes instead.
PALC    Palette C       Like palette A, but all zeroes instead.
PALD    Palette D       Like palette A, but all zeroes instead.
COLS    Colors          Always contains zeroes.
CCCL    ?               Contains 64 bytes of unknown data. This seems to differ very slightly per level.
IFFC    ?               Bitsets for each tile. First 6 bits are the default special for each tile in the tilemap.
                        The other 10 bits are unused.
BODY    Body            The actual level data. From left to right, top to bottom, the first 6 bits are the tile's
                        special. The last 10 bits are an index into the 16x16 tile graphics. See Tile specials.

It's not unthinkable that the Superfrog "engine" or parts thereof had been used before in games like Project-X,
which might have the similar level format, with more of the chunks actually being used.


Tile specials
==============
The following is a list of special values that can be associated with a tile. Enemies vary per world, see "Enemies".
Project F uses a different list to place the enemies.

Notes
 - World 3's water end anims are not always used in maps where they should have been. I haven't found the rt. (right) variant yet,
   I only suspect it would be right below the left variant.
 - In world 3, Enemy 1 is used twice, but is never seen. Possibly a leftover.


Music
======
Music is in the Mod ProTracker Packed format, recognizable by the P41A magic bytes.
